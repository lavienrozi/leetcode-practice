# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

Example 2:

Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].

 

Constraints:

    0 <= low <= high <= 10^9


## Solution1 
Brutal force. 

`(low_lim % 2 != 0)` need to use `!=` operator other than `==`.


## Solution2
Math method.

Intuition

we will calculate all odd number from 1 to low-1 and 1 to high;
why (low-1)?
because we want include our low value.
Approach

    Total odd number between 1 and low - 1 is low/2.
    Total odd number between 1 and high is (high + 1 ) / 2.
    For getting answer we will do
    Total odd number between 1 and high - Total odd number between 1 and low - 1

Complexity

    Time complexity:O(1)
    Space complexity:O(1)
