# 2444. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds

You are given an integer array nums and two integers minK and maxK.

A fixed-bound subarray of nums is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:

    The minimum value in the subarray is equal to minK.
    The maximum value in the subarray is equal to maxK.

Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,2,7,5], minK = 1, maxK = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The fixed-bound subarrays are [1,3,5] and [1,3,5,2].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1], minK = 1, maxK = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: Every subarray of nums is a fixed-bound subarray. There are 10 possible subarrays.

 

Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    1 <= nums[i], minK, maxK <= 10^6

## Solution 1
not correct. only account for right minK &rarr; maxk direction.

## Solution 2
From singhabhinash

Intuition of this Problem:

This solution works by iterating over the given array nums and keeping track of the most recent positions of the minimum value minK and the maximum value maxK in the array, as well as the most recent index leftBound outside the range [minK, maxK].

For each element in the array, if it falls within the range [minK, maxK], the code updates the most recent positions of minK and maxK, calculates the number of subarrays that can be formed between the most recent positions of minK and maxK, and adds this count to the answer.

If the current element falls outside the range [minK, maxK], the code updates the leftBound index to the current index i, and resets the most recent positions of minK and maxK to -1.

In the end, the code returns the total count of valid subarrays.
Approach for this Problem:

The approach used in the given code can be classified as a two-pointer approach. We are maintaining two pointers, lastMin and lastMax, that track the most recent occurrences of minK and maxK, respectively. The variable leftBound represents the left endpoint of the current subarray being considered. By comparing the values of lastMin, lastMax, and leftBound, we are able to determine the number of valid subarrays within the range [minK, maxK].

Explanation of code point wise :

    int n = nums.size(); : This statement initializes a variable n with the size of the input vector nums.
    int leftBound = -1; : This statement initializes a variable leftBound to -1. This variable represents the index of the left endpoint of the current subarray being considered. Initially, there is no subarray being considered, so we set leftBound to -1.
    int lastMin = -1, lastMax = -1; : These statements initialize two variables lastMin and lastMax to -1. These variables represent the indices of the most recent occurrences of minK and maxK, respectively. Initially, there are no occurrences of minK and maxK, so we set both variables to -1.
    long long count = 0; : This statement initializes a variable count to 0. This variable represents the count of valid subarrays that we will be computing.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... } n : This statement starts a loop that iterates over each element of the input vector nums.
    if (nums[i] >= minK && nums[i] <= maxK) { ... } : This statement checks if the current element nums[i] is within the range [minK, maxK].
    lastMin = (nums[i] == minK) ? i : lastMin; : This statement updates lastMin to the current index i if nums[i] is equal to minK, otherwise it leaves lastMin unchanged.
    lastMax = (nums[i] == maxK) ? i : lastMax; : This statement updates lastMax to the current index i if nums[i] is equal to maxK, otherwise it leaves lastMax unchanged.
    count += max(0, min(lastMin, lastMax) - leftBound); : This statement computes the number of valid subarrays that end at the current index i and adds it to the total count. The number of valid subarrays is equal to the number of subarrays whose minimum and maximum elements are both in the range [minK, maxK].
