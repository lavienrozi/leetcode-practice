# 1259. Handshakes That Don't Cros

You are given an even number of people numPeople that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else so that there are numPeople / 2 handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:
![5125 Example 2](5125_example_2.png)

Input: numPeople = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to do it, the first way is [(1,2),(3,4)] and the second one is [(2,3),(4,1)].

Example 2:
![5125 Example 3](5125_example_3.png)

Input: numPeople = 6
Output: 5

 

Constraints:

    2 <= numPeople <= 1000
    numPeople is even.

Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occur in many counting problems. The first few Catalan numbers are:

1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, ...

The nth Catalan number can be defined recursively as follows:

C_0 = 1
C_n = (2n * (2n - 1)) / ((n + 1) * n) * C_{n-1}

Alternatively, it can be computed using the following formula:

C_n = (1/(n+1)) * binomial(2n, n)

Catalan numbers have many combinatorial interpretations and arise in a variety of mathematical problems, such as counting the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses, the number of rooted binary trees with n+1 leaves, and the number of ways to triangulate a polygon with n+2 sides. They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugï¿½ne Charles Catalan.
