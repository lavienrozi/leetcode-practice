# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
# Keywords: CMake, string
Given a string s, find the length of the longest
substring
without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

 

Constraints:

    0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
    s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.



## Solution 1
Spent more time than I expected. Find the matched element and erase() it as well as the elements before it. The counts will also reduce the corresponding number. 
I have not learned the big (O) yet. 
I guess the complexity will be linear. 
beat 80% on time. 

## Solution 2
Case study.
A concise code design using `std::max` in `algorithm` library.
