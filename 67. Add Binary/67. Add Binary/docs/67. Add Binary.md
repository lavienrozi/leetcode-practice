# 67. Add Binary

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"

 

Constraints:

    1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4
    a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
    Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.




## Solution1
Idea:
convert the binary string into the `int`.
Then perform the `sum` operation. At last, convert the `sum` result back to `std::string`.

Problem: because the constraints: "1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4".
The long string binary can not shift.
The error:

"runtime error: shift exponent 100 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'"

sad:(

## Solution2
Brute computation.
Principle of bit addition with `carry`.

## Solution3
`carry` variable carries the calculating
