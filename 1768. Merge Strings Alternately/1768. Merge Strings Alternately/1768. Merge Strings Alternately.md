# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately
---
You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
**Output:** "apbqcr"
**Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
**Output:** "apbqrs"
**Explanation:** Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
**Output:** "apbqcd"
**Explanation:** Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
-   `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

Runtime0 ms
Beats 100%
Memory6.4 MB
Beats 19.35% (but why? preallocating memoery makes it inefficient? running space was $O(1)$, preallocating make it $O(n+m)$)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string ans;
        ans.reserve(word1.size() + word2.size()); // Preallocate memory
        auto it_1 = word1.begin();
        auto it_2 = word2.begin();
        while (it_1 != word1.end() && it_2 != word2.end()) {
            ans += *it_1++;
            ans += *it_2++;
        }
        for (auto it = it_1; it != word1.end(); ++it) {
            ans += *it;
        }
        for (auto it = it_2; it != word2.end(); ++it) {
            ans += *it;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2
one pointer other than #DSA/Two-Pointers 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        int m = word1.size();
        int n = word2.size();
        string result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < max(m, n); i++) {
            if (i < m) {
                result.push_back(word1[i]);
            }
            if (i < n) {
                result.push_back(word2[i]);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        ans = ""
        n, m=0, 0     
        while (n<len(word1) or m<len(word2)):
            if n<len(word1):
                ans += word1[n]
                n += 1
            if m<len(word2):
                ans += word2[m]
                m += 1
        return ans
```

## Solution 2
slice the string: #DSA/String 
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        answer = ""

        for i in range(min(len(word1), len(word2))):
            answer = answer + word1[i] + word2[i]
        return answer + word1[min(len(word1), len(word2)):] + word2[min(len(word1), len(word2)):]
```
## Solution 3
similiarly, slice and cut, then join
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        out = ''
        n = min([len(word1), len(word2)])
        word1 = list(word1)
        word2 = list(word2)
        for i in range(n):
            out = out+word1[0]+word2[0]
            word1.remove(word1[0])
            word2.remove(word2[0])
        out = out + ''.join(word1) + ''.join(word2)
        return out
```
