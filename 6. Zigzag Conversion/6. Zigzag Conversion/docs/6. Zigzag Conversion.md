# 6. Zigzag Conversion

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R

And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I

Example 3:

Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 1000
    s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
    1 <= numRows <= 1000



## Solution 2
Complexity

    Time complexity: O(n^2)

    Space complexity: O(1)



## Solution 3


we have value=1 and down false so reduce value agin by one unit .
see above picture and try to relate it you will understand , read how down bool is changing and value is being increased and decreased.
time complexity :- o(n) where n is length of string
space complexity :- o(n)
