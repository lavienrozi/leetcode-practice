# 760. Find Anagram Mappings
---
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` where `nums2` is **an anagram** of `nums1`. Both arrays may contain duplicates.

Return _an index mapping array_ `mapping` _from_ `nums1` _to_ `nums2` _where_ `mapping[i] = j` _means the_ `ith` _element in_ `nums1` _appears in_ `nums2` _at index_ `j`. If there are multiple answers, return **any of them**.

An array `a` is **an anagram** of an array `b` means `b` is made by randomizing the order of the elements in `a`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [12,28,46,32,50], nums2 = [50,12,32,46,28]
**Output:** [1,4,3,2,0]
**Explanation:** As mapping[0] = 1 because the 0th element of nums1 appears at nums2[1], and mapping[1] = 4 because the 1st element of nums1 appears at nums2[4], and so on.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [84,46], nums2 = [84,46]
**Output:** [0,1]

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums1.length <= 100`
-   `nums2.length == nums1.length`
-   `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^5`
-   `nums2` is an anagram of `nums1`.


## Solution 1
#DSA/Hashing 
- record `nums2` into a hasing map of <val,index> pair
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> anagramMappings(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        std::unordered_map<int,int> ump;
        std::vector<int> res;
        for (int i=0;i<nums2.size();i++) ump[nums2[i]]=i;
        for (int i=0;i<nums1.size();i++) {
            auto it = ump.find(nums1[i]);
            if (it!=ump.end()) res.push_back(it->second);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
-   Time complexity: O(N).
    
    We first iterate over the list `nums1` to store the indices in the map and then iterate over the first list `nums1` to get the corresponding index in the second list from the map. Therefore, the total time complexity equals O(N).
    
-   Space complexity: O(N).
    
    We need O(N) space to store the indices in the unordered map `valueToPos`; thus, the total space complexity equals O(N).

## Solution 2
#### Bit Manipulation + Sorting
**Intuition**
	Note: This approach is more advanced, requires changing the input lists, is slower than the previous approach, and hence is not advisable. This approach has been added for the sake of completion or if the interviewer specifically asks for it. We will assume that you are already familiar with bit operations.

Both given lists are anagrams of each other, so if we sort both of them, then the same integers would come at the same indices (the arrays are equal). For example, `nums1 = {2, 3, 2, 1}` and `nums2 = {3, 2, 1, 2}`, then after sorting both lists will be `{1, 2, 2, 3}`. Now, before sorting, we can store each element with its index (using pair or tuple etc.) to keep track of the original indices as in the final mapping, we will be storing the original index of each integer in the list `nums2`.

Instead of storing indices separately, we can save space using bit manipulation to store the index within the integer itself. This can be done using the left shift (<<<<<<) operator; we will shift both integer lists before sorting and adding their indices to them; these indices would be in the `0's` that would have been created due to shifting. Also, after sorting, we can fetch the original index of integers by performing bit-wise AND (&\&&) operations and use them to create the final mappings.

Now, the next question is, how many bits should we shift the integers to the left? After shifting, we need to add an index to the number, which could be at max 99. So we need to at least create as many `0's` in the end to accommodate 99. Hence, if we left shift the integer by, say, xxx bits, then the last xxx bits can make the maximum number as 2^x−1, which has to be greater than or equal to 99, i.e. 2x−1≥99. This implies xxx should be equal to 7 at least.

> **Note** that we are working with integers here that have 32 bits in C++/Java; in total, we will need 24 bits: 17 bits for the original integer (10^5) and 7 extra bits for the left shift. Hence, this logic can work here; any change in the problem constraint might invalidate this approach.

Also, to get the original index from the left-shifted integer, we can perform the AND (&) operation with 2^7−1=127. This is because 127 equals 01111111, i.e. the last 7 bits are 1, and the rest are 0. Hence, when we perform the AND operation, every bit except the last 7 will become 0.

**Algorithm**

1.  Iterate over each integer in the list `nums1` and `nums2` and shift them by `bitsToShift = 7` bits to the left and then add their indices to it.
2.  Sort the list `nums1` and `nums2`.
3.  Iterate over the indices from 000 to N−1N - 1N−1, and for each, store the index of the integer in the list `nums2` in the list `mappings` at the index of the integer in the list `nums1`. We can use bit manipulation as described above to retrieve the indices.
4.  Return `mappings`
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    const int bitsToShift = 7;
    const int numToGetLastBits = (1 << bitsToShift) - 1;
    
    vector<int> anagramMappings(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        // Store the index within the integer itself.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
            nums1[i] = (nums1[i] << bitsToShift) + i;
            nums2[i] = (nums2[i] << bitsToShift) + i;
        }
        
        // Sort both lists so that the original integers end up at the same index.
        sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        sort(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
        
        // List to store the anagram mappings.
        vector<int> mappings(nums1.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); i++) {
            // Store the index in the second list corresponding to the integer index in the first list.
            mappings[nums1[i] & numToGetLastBits] = (nums2[i] & numToGetLastBits);
        }

        return mappings;
    }
};
```
**Complexity Analysis**

Here, NNN is the number of integers in the list `nums1` and `nums2`.

-   Time complexity: O(Nlog⁡N).
    
    We first iterate over the lists; this takes O(N) time. Then we sort the lists, which would take O(Nlog⁡N) time. Then we again iterate over the list to create mappings. Therefore the total time complexity equals O(Nlog⁡N).
    
-   Space complexity: O(log⁡N).
    
    The lists used for input and output are not considered in the space complexity. However, some space is required for sorting. The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the implementation of each programming language. For instance, in Java, the `Arrays.sort()` for primitives is implemented as a variant of the quicksort algorithm whose space complexity is O(log⁡⁡N). In C++ `sort()` function provided by STL is a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort and has a worst-case space complexity of O(log⁡⁡N). Thus, the inbuilt sort() function might add up to O(log⁡⁡N) to space complexity. Hence, the space complexity equals O(log⁡⁡N).
