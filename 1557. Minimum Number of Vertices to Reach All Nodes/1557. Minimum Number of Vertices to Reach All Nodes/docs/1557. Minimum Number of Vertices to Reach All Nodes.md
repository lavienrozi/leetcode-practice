# 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes
---
Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.

Find _the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable_. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
**Output:** [0,3]
**Explanation:** It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/07/untitled.png)

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
**Output:** [0,2,3]
**Explanation:** Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= n <= 10^5`
-   `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
-   `edges[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= from_i, to_i < n`
-   All pairs `(from_i, to_i)` are distinct.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // if it is reachable, then it means there is
        // an directional incoming edge (at least one)
        // create an vector variable
        // and if the edge exits in the vertex[i][1]
        // set the index (vertex) to true
        std::vector<bool> incomingEdge(n, false);
        for (vector<int>& v : edges) incomingEdge[v[1]] = true;
        // result vector to append the vertice that has no incoming
        std::vector<int> ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < n ; i++) {
            if (!incomingEdge[i]) ans.push_back(i);
        }
        return ans;  
    }
};
```

note:
Knowledge of toposort (specifically Kahn's algo) helps to crack the problem instantly.
How can you reach nodes with no `incoming` edges? The only way to reach the nodes is to start traversal from the nodes.

```python
return set(range(n)) - set(v for _,v in edges)
```

OR

```python
return {e[0] for e in edges} - {e[1] for e in edges}
```
